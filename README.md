# tribute-page-fcc

This is a design project for completing [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)'s *Responsive Web Design Certification*. The goal is to make a tribute page to someone. I've choose to honor Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web.

Here it is the model: https://tribute-page.freecodecamp.rocks/

Here it is my version: https://italo617.github.io/tribute-page-fcc/
